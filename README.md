# American Express Campus Challenge 2024 - T20 Match Prediction
This repository contains my project for the American Express Campus Challenge 2024, where I ranked in the top 10 among over 1000 teams from premier institutions like IITs and IIMs. The goal was to predict T20 match outcomes by building a high-accuracy predictive model.

## Key highlights:
### 1.Feature Engineering: Developed 14 novel features (e.g., win ratios, historical data) to enrich the dataset, with feature selection via Mutual Information and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis.
### 2. Model Optimization: Tuned hyperparameters using Bayesian Optimization and Grid Search CV to maximize model performance.
### 3. Algorithms Used: Implemented various boosting algorithms, including XGBoost, CatBoost, GBM, and LightGBM, along with ensemble techniques.
### 4. Results: Achieved a 64% predictive accuracy with XGBoost on a training dataset of 948 data points.

This project demonstrates a robust approach to sports data analysis, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and feature engineering to drive actionable insights.
